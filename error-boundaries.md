# Error Boundaries

If you do not have any error boundaries within your app, when something breaks the whole UI would break. For this reason React introduced the concept of error boundaries.

Error boundaries catch any errors in their child component tree, log these errors and display a fallback ui. Errors are caught during rendering, in lifecycle methods and in constructors of the whole tree below them.

Error boundaries do **not** catch errors for:

- Event handlers
- Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
- Server side rendering
- Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)

Error boundaries work like a JavaScript catch {} block, but for components. Only class components can be error boundaries. Most of the time youâ€™ll want to declare an error boundary component once and use it throughout your application.

## Error Boundary Components

To make use of error boundaries you would need to setup an class component.It becomes an error boundary if it defines either (or both) of the lifecycle methods `getDerivedStateFromError()` or `componentDidCatch()`.

Use `getDerivedStateFromError()` to render a fallback UI after an error has been thrown. Use `componentDidCatch()` to log error information.

```javascript
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children; 
  }
}
```

Then you can use it as a regular component.

```javascript
<ErrorBoundary>
  <OtherComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

It's a good idea to wrap top-level components in an error boundary to display a "something went wrong" error message. You can also use error boundary components around individual components to prevent them from crashing the entire application.


## Event Handlers

By default error boundaries do not work with event handlers. If you need to catch an error inside event handler, use the regular JavaScript try / catch statement:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { error: null };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    try {
      // Do something that could throw
    } catch (error) {
      this.setState({ error });
    }
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.error) {
      return <h1>Caught an error.</h1>
    }
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
  }
}
```
