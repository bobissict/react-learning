# React Learning

Messing around with react concepts and other usefull libraries in the eco system ðŸ¤“ Also trying to document any usefull/reusable stuff I find along the way.

## React Toolchains

For the purpose of this playground I will be using the create-react-app toolchain. In future I will setup seperate repos for the other toolchains listed.

- Create React App - single page apps
- Gatsby - static generated websites
- Next.js - server rendered apps

### Create React App

Create React App is a super quick way to setup a new react app with all the opinionated dev environment stuff from the React team. The documentation is really good so no need to expand on it further than the link below.
