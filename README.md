# React Playground

Messing around with react concepts and other usefull libraries in the eco system ðŸ¤“ Also trying to document any usefull/reusable stuff I find along the way.

## React Toolchains

For the purpose of this playground I will be using the create-react-app toolchain. In future I will setup seperate repos for the other toolchains listed.

- Create React App - single page apps
- Gatsby - static generated websites
- Next.js - server rendered apps

## React Concepts

- Code Splitting
- Context
- Error Boundaries
- Forwarding Refs
- Fragments - done
- Higher Order Components
- Portals
- Profiler
- Refs and the DOM
- Render Props
- Hooks
- Testing
